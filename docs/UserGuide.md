## Features
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: How to read our commands:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the details to be given by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a detail which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Details in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times or none at all.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Details can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Troubleshooting
<a name="issues"></a>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

## FAQ
<a name="FAQ"></a>
**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous StudentBook home folder.

**Q**: There are 12 tutorials on the attendance list, but my module has less than 12 tutorials per sem.
**A**: In a typical semester, there are 13 weeks. Tutorials can start earlier or later, so to accomodate the largest possible number of tutorials, npc_track
has 12 weeks' worth of tutorials to grade.

**Q**: I have two students that share the exact same name. How can npc_track support this?
**A**: npc_track cannot handle students with the exact same name. However, you can consider adding something else to their names to distinguish between them.

So for example, if you have 2 students called "Arnab Goav", you can name one student "Arnab Goav 1" and the other "Arnab Goav 2".
