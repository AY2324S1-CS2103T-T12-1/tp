# Welcome to `Npc_track`

## Tracking the details of your students is on the cusp of your fingertips!

`npc_track` is a desktop application curtailed for the humble teaching assistants of SoC via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, `npc_track` can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Here’s an overview of how `npc_track` can help you streamline your student management process:
- Store, delete and edit information about your students!
- Track the progress of your students
- ...

On top of these functionalities, we believe that student management should be extremely efficient. `npc_track` is optimized for use via the familiar command line interface (CLI) for linux / fans of terminal applications as well as the benefits of an appealing user interface for TA’s more inclined to them!

`npc_track` is for all TA’s, and is adaptable for their management and organisational styles!

## Quick start


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features
<a name="features"></a>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Known issues
<a name="issues"></a>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
