### Project: Npc_Track

Npc_Track is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still 
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Npc_Track can get your contact 
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
