### Project: npc_track

npc_track is a desktop app for managing student contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still 
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Npc_Track can get your contact 
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.


Given below are my contributions to the project.
