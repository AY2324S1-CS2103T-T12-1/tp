### Project: npc_track

npc_track is a desktop app for managing student contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Npc_Track can get your contact
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.


Given below are my contributions to the project:

- **New Feature**
	- Added a Ui.
	- Feature to add: Update the Attendance system to include different types of attendances.
- **Code contributed**

	- Edited MainWindow.fxml
	- Edited DarkMode.css
	- Code contribution plans: Updated attendance system
		- To be included: An attendance status system
		- This would help to distinguish if a particular student has either attended a tutorial, was absent, or was absent with a valid reason. This would also show the number of tutorials unmarked thus far.
		- Improve the tutorial participation system. Right now, it is set to just only have 0, 1 and 2. I propose to improve it to arbitrarily add a tutorial participation score based on the user input.
- **Project management**
	- Managed release `v1.1` as a practice on Github
	- Helped to contribute and conduct v1.2
	- Contributed to v1.2b
	- Helped to plan v1.3, particularly the division of work.
- **Enhancements to existing features:**
	- Made the Ui mockup
	- Generally completed the Ui
	- To be added: npc_track Ui logo
-**Documentation:**
	- To be added (improved attendance and participation commands)
	- To help improve: Glossary and setup page.
-**Community**

-**Tools**

-**Contributions to the Developer Guide (DG) and UML Diagrams**
